        "This is one of my favorite thoughts,
        small but profound. 
        This one is from the movie 
        'Avengers: Endgame,' 
        where Iron Man shares it with his father.
        I believe a nice thought on your
        birthday can give you a po
        sitive mindset for your journey ahead. 
        My best wishes are always with you. 
        Just be happy!
